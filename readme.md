## Testproject with webpack, react and stylus
(forget about stylus and flux... maybe another day)

### Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Limu123/webpack-react-stylus-flux.git
$ cd webpack-react-stylus-flux/
$ npm install
```
(you might have to install webpack and react globaly)
The fonts aren't committed intentionally. Create a folder 'app/font' and place them there.

### Run
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
---> localhost:8080
